API DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

See shoutbox_group.module for a detailed example

@param $op
  The current operation (see code below)
@param $shout
  The shout object used in the operation
@param $form_state
  The form state of the shout form. Usually only used on the shoutbox form.
  Modules like shoutbox_group attach extra data to the form with a form_alter

function hook_shoutbox($op, &$shout, &$a1 = NULL, $form_state = NULL) {
  switch ($op) {
    case 'insert':
      // A shout was just added
      break;
      
    case 'presave':
      // A shout is about to be saved
      break;
    
    case 'edit':
      // An edited shout is about to be saved
      break;
      
    case 'view':
      // A shout is about to be viewed
      break;
      
    case 'unpublish':
      // A shout is being unpublished
      // Will not be called if a shout is initially saved unpublished
      break;
      
    case 'publish':
      // A shout is being published
      // Will not be called if a shout is initially saved published
      break;
    
    case 'delete':
      // A shout was just removed
      break;
      
    case 'link':
      // Alter the link to the shoutbox page
      $a1 = 'shoutbox/something/custom';
      break;
      
    case 'form':
      // Alter the shoutbox add form
      $a1['new_field'] = array('#type' => 'textbox', etc);
      break;
      
    case 'js path':
      // Alter the AJAX callback path
      $a1 = 'something/js/callback';
      break;
      
    case 'query':
      // Alter the database query used to fetch shouts
      $a1 = "SELECT s.* FROM {shoutbox} s INNER JOIN ....";
      break;
  }
}

******************************* IMPORTANT ***********************************
If it recommended that in presave, you set $shout->module to the name of your
module. This will prevent shoutbox from displaying your module's shouts on
general shoutboxes - unless that is what is desired.
