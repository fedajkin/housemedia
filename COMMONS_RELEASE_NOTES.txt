Drupal Commons 1.6, 2010-05-25
------------------------------------
NOTES:
- This is both a feature release, as well as updating Drupal core with
  the latest security update.
- The key features of this release are 2 new themes, page layouts updated for
  improved usability, more capabilities being moved into individual (Drupal)
  Features, the ability to enable (/disable) Features on a per-group basis,
  a change from using Context+Panels to using Context (only), along with
  other minor changes.
- 2 new themes have been added. If you would like to use them, navigate to
  the theme administration page to enable them. Make sure that Fusion remains
  enabled, as well as Commons Roots, a new Commons base theme.
- The panels module and all previously included panels have been removed
  from the distribution. In previous versions, the home page, user profile,
  and group home page were rendered by Panels. If you'd like to continue 
  using panels, you must download the module separately and place it in your
  sites/all/modules directory. Since the panel exports that came with Commons 
  are now gone, in order to continue using them, you must save a copy of 
  them from within the panels UI prior to upgrading to 1.6, so they remain
  in your database.
- Context is now being used to render all of the previously mentioned pages,
  as well as all other pages.
- The Admin Menu module has been replaced by the Admin module. This provides
  several benefits: it eliminates the nuiscance of menus dropping down and
  interfering with usability; and it contains an editor for the Context module,
  which is required in order to control the vertical ordering of blocks on a
  page when being controlled by Context. Click the wrench icon in the top-right
  corner of any page to view both the Context editor as well as the normal
  "Admin" functions previously found in the Admin Menu.  To edit Contexts,
  click on "Context editor" in that sidebar; from there, you can edit the
  blocks and their layout for every page.
- OG Features has been added to the distribution. This allows admins and 
  group managers to turn off groups of features within each individual
  group. Group Admins will now see a "Features" tab beside the Edit tab on
  the group home page where these can be controlled.
- All of the Features within the distribution have been rebuilt, leading
  to most of the exports (views, contexts, etc) being renamed and redesigned.
  If you have altered and saved any of the previous exports, they will 
  persist within your database. It is important that you carefully review
  any of these depreciated components and disable or remove them to they 
  do not interfere with the new ones.
  (See: http://commons.acquia.com/wiki/feature-components-removed-commons-16) 
- There are also two new Features available:
 - Commons Shoutbox: Contains the Shoutbox components from Commons Core,
   making it possible to now completely disable Shoutbox from Commons,
   if desired.
 - Commons Invite: Provides functionality to allow site users to invite other
   people to your site.
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 1.6:
NOTE: THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE.  You should NOT install it directly on
a live site without first testing it on a staging site.
1. Carefully review the NOTES above
2. Backup your code and database
3. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
4. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of this archive.
 - It is important that you do not *merge* the new codebase, as a number of modules were
   remove or relocated!
5. Update your site via /update.php
 - Ignore any errors about missing Panels files
6. Make sure the Page manager module is disabled. Or, if you wish to continue
  using it, delete any pages using the path "/home", the Node template, and
  the User profile template, which may be leftover from a previous version 
  of Commons.
7. Navigate to the admin theme page (admin/build/themes)
 - Ensure that Fusion Core and Commons Roots (both base themes) are enabled
 - Ensure that at least one Commons-supported theme is enabled, and choose
   your desired default theme (if not already set)
 - The original Acquia Commons theme is now named Commons Origins
8. View the status report (admin/reports/status) to see if there are any
  errors to tend to
9. Take the time to delete or disable any of the components listed at:
   http://commons.acquia.com/wiki/feature-components-removed-commons-16
  - This is extremely important!
  - Once done, navigate to all areas of your site, making sure there is 
    no remaining strange or duplicate behavior of any kind.
10. Navigate to the Features admin page (admin/build/features)
 - Determine which features are overridden
 - Click on the overridden link for each feature to review what the 
   the overrides are for each component inside the given feature
 - If possible, revert as many components as possible, remembering that
   reverting a component will remove any customizations you've made to
   the given item
11. A bug revealed in Heartbeat led to the need for an additional permission
  to be created (access user activity). Users will need this permission
  in order to see the activity streams on group home pages. Commons comes
  with this permission given to anonymous and authenticated users by default,
  but you may have to either revert the Commons Core feature, or assigned
  the permissions manually, if upgrading.
12. Because of the introduction of Commons Profile (Feature) to handle
  the profile aspects of Commons, if you have deleted any profile fields
  that came with Commons initially, they will be restored after the upgrade.
  You must go in (admin/user/profile) and remove them once again.
13. If no issues have arisen, it is recommended that you make another backup
  of your codebase and database, then you may turn off maintenance mode.

Drupal Commons 1.3, 2011-02-04
------------------------------------
NOTES:
 - Excluded module updates:
  * User terms
    - Commons 1.0 contained a large patch which introduced free-tagging to
      user terms. Until we re-evaluate exactly what functionality we want
      for user tagging, we will continue to use the version that we started
      with.
 - Commons Dashboard [new feature] requires PHP 5.2.x (or higher)
  * This is because of the Homebox module, which uses functions introduced
    in PHP 5.2.
  * If you do not have PHP 5.2.x (or higher) installed, this feature will
    not be enabled during a site upgrade, and will not be available during
    site installation. If you upgrade to an adequate version of PHP at a
    later time, you can enable this feature via the Features admin interface.
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 1.3:
1. Backup your code and database
2. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
3. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of this archive.
 - It is important that you do not *merge* the new codebase, as a number of modules were
   remove or relocated!
4. Update your site via /update.php
5. Ignore any errors about missing included/required files 
 - Those are caused by some modules changing location
 - Ignore SQL errors from Context and/or Rules
6. View the status of the features (admin/build/features)
7. If any features are overridden, view the components of the feature that are overridden
 - It's recommended that you revert all the overridden components, but be aware that
   this will revert any custom changes you've made to those components
8. Review the available Contexts (admin/build/context)
 - Delete or disable context_ui-dashboard-dashboard, as it's no longer used by Commons
   but may still be saved in your database
9. Review the available Pages (admin/build/pages)
 - Delete or disable page-Home, as it's no longer used by Commons but may
   still be saved in your database
 - Being that Commons 1.2 now comes with a new home page, you may want to review
   it and make any changes you deem necessary
10. Review your input format and filters. WYSIWYG Filter has been set to be used
  in place of HTML Filter (for the Filtered HTML format)
11. Review the user permissions and roles
12. Clear the cache (admin/settings/performance)
13. Ensure the rest of your site is functioning as expected
14. Check the status report for any errors. Address them, if needed.
