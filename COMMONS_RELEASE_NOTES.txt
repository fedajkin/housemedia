Commons 2.0, 2011-08-30
------------------------------------
For the formatted, online version of the release notes see:
 * http://network.acquia.com/documentation/commons/upgrade
------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION:
This release provides a powerful new way for site users to interact: 
 It changes an authenticated user's default page to be a page showing an 
 stream of activities & status updates from people users follow. A 
 similar activity stream is shown on group home pages. It follows the 
 usability pattern in use by other leading consumer social sites, but 
 adapts it to business-type use, and as well as adapting it to the 
 groups-style information architecture used in Commons.

This upgrade adds or changes some significant functionality, so we 
strongly recommend that you test the upgrade on a staging site before 
performing the upgrade on a live site.

The official name of this distribution is changing from Drupal Commons 
to (just) Commons. This change is not fully implemented throughout the 
distribution; it may take several releases to gradually change all 
aspects and avoid breakage.
------------------------------------
NOTES:
- This release changes the default behavior of Notifications. Previously users
  were automatically subscribed to content they created or commented on,
  and they then received an email every time someone else commented on that
  content. This release disables that behavior by default, although existing
  users' preferences will not be changed and new users can still choose to
  enable that behavior. Instead, by default users will receive a daily email
  of all activity on the site that is relevant to them just like they see in
  the new activity streams on the site. Users can choose to receive this email
  weekly instead of daily, or disable it altogether. Administrators can
  customize the email format at admin/settings/digests.

- The Dashboard feature will be disabled during the upgrade to 2.0. You can
  re-enable it if you want to, but keep in mind that it will probably be
  deprecated and eventually removed in upcoming Commons releases.

- This release re-organizes some of the blocks on user profile pages and group
  home pages. If you have overridden the Contexts that provide the layout on
  these pages, we strongly recommend that you revert your changes in the
  Commons Core feature so that you can use the latest updates and make any
  further changes afterwards as necessary.

 - This release switches from the Shoutbox module to the Facebook-style Statuses
  module and from the Heartbeat module to the Activity Log module. (When you
  upgrade from a previous version, the Commons Shoutbox feature will be
  disabled and the Commons Activity Stream feature will be enabled in its
  place). Much functionality is gained in this transition, but some features
  have changed or are no longer supported:
  - Shoutbox natively supports only showing shouts if an administrator has
    manually approved them. This is strongly discouraged. If you still want to
    do this with Facebook-style Statuses, you must create a new "Approve" Flag
    and set statuses to only appear if they have been approved. This requires
    the following steps:
    - Go to admin/build/flags/add. Choose a name for your flag, and select
      "Facebook-style Statuses" from the list. Click the "Submit" button and
      then fill out the required details on the following page. Be sure to make
      your flag "global."
    - Go to admin/rules/trigger. You will need to disable each of the following
      rules, and create new equivalent Rules to log activity when a status has
      been flagged as Approved instead of when it is created:
      - "Log activity when a user saves a personal status update"
      - "Log activity when a user sends a status message"
      - "Log activity when a user saves a personal status update with an
        attachment"
      - "Log activity when a user sends a status message with an attachment"
    - Add the Facebook-style Statuses: All Statuses page to an administrative
      menu so that moderators can find it easily (statuses/all).
    - Follow the instructions at http://drupal.org/node/1135266#flag to add
      your "Approve" flag to the All Statuses view.
  - Any custom Rules or Contexts that you created or modified for Shoutbox or
    Heartbeat and that you want to preserve must be recreated for
    Facebook-style Statuses and Activity Log. However, the Commons Activity
    Streams feature provides default Rules that should work well for most
    sites.
  - Facebook-style Statuses has support for general shouts (i.e. shouts posted
    to the site rather than a user or group) but there is not an upgrade path
    for these shouts because they are not exposed anywhere in the Commons
    interface. The same situation applies to shouts that use Domain Access. If
    you need to port this data and you write an upgrade path for it, please
    contribute it back at http://drupal.org/node/1228504
  - If you used the Heartbeat Shouts module (which is different than the
    Shoutbox module) then follow the instructions at | in order to upgrade to
    Facebook-style Statuses.
  - If you used the Heartbeat Comments module, upgrading to Activity Log is not
    yet supported. (You can upgrade without problems, but comments on activity
    will be lost.) This is not the same as the core Comments module, which is
    fully supported.
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 2.0
** This upgrade adds or changes some significant functionality, so we
** strongly recommend that you test the upgrade on a staging site before
** performing the upgrade on a live site. Be sure to read the NOTES 
** above before proceeding
1. Back up your code (everything in your Drupal root directory) and your
   database
2. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
3. If you have custom Rules or Contexts for the Shoutbox or Heartbeat modules,
   make a note of them (you may want to export them as well). Shoutbox and
   Heartbeat will be disabled during the upgrade and replaced with the new
   Facebook-style Statuses and Activity Log modules. You can re-enable them
   afterwards if you want, but that is strongly discouraged.
4. Replace your code (everything in your Drupal root directory except the sites
   directory) with the contents of this archive
5. Run the update script at /update.php
   - Ignore all errors related to the heartbeat module that pertain to 
     required files being unable to load. This is because that module has
     been removed and those files no longer exist.
   - It is likely that update.php will report the following message:
       "Unable to regenerate activity messages because no Rules events were found.
        Try regnerating activity messages again."
     Click the link inside that message. This will take you to the Activity Log
    administration page, on the Regenerate Activity tab.
6. After following that link, click the "Regenerate" button and allow the
   operation to finish. You do not need to set any of the options provided on that
   page; simply click Regenerate.
7. On that same page (Activity Log administration), click on the "Settings" tab,
    then press the "Clear all message caches" button.
8. Change the default user relationship from (two-way) "Friend" to (one-way) Follow.
    (This is because the new activity stream feature in 2.0 allows you to see your
    friends' activity as a one-way activity, a'la Twitter). To do this, go to
    /admin/user/relationships and click "edit" next to the "Friend" relationship.
    On the "Edit type" page that will appear, change the "Name" and "Plural name"
    fields to "follower" and "users you follow," respectively. Then un-check the
    "Requires Approval" box, and check the "This is a one-way relationship" box.
    A new box will appear labeled "This one-way relationship can be
    reciprocated," and you should check that as well. Then click the "Submit"
    button at the bottom of the page.
9. View the status report (admin/reports/status) to see if there are any
   errors that must be addressed
10. If you had custom Rules or Contexts from step 3, you should re-create them
   now for the Facebook-style Statuses and Activity Log modules. If you're
   unsure what this step is referring to, then you do not have to do anything.
11. Given the new interface additions in this release, you may need to add new
    CSS styling to the theme for your site if you have built a custom theme for
    your common-based site.
11. The Dashboard feature will be disabled during the upgrade. If you still want
    to use it, you can re-enable it. However, keep in mind that it will probably
    be deprecated in upcoming releases of Commons.
12. This release re-organizes some of the blocks on user profile pages and group
    home pages. If you have overridden the Contexts that provide the layout on
    these pages, we strongly recommend that you revert your changes in the
    Commons Core feature so that you can use the latest updates and make any
    further changes afterwards as necessary.
13. If no issues have arisen, then you may turn off maintenance mode.

------------------------------------
NOTES:
- This release was built in response to a security issue that arose in
  the CKEditor library (See: http://drupal.org/node/1189632)
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 1.7
1. Backup your code and database
2. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
3. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents 
  of this archive.
4. Update your site via /update.php
5. View the status report (admin/reports/status) to see if there are any
  errors to tend to

- Fixed: Various theme issues


Commons 1.6, 2011-05-25
------------------------------------
NOTES:
- This is both a feature release, as well as updating Drupal core with
  the latest security update.
- The key features of this release are 2 new themes, page layouts updated for
  improved usability, more capabilities being moved into individual (Drupal)
  Features, the ability to enable (/disable) Features on a per-group basis,
  a change from using Context+Panels to using Context (only), along with
  other minor changes.
- 2 new themes have been added. If you would like to use them, navigate to
  the theme administration page to enable them. Make sure that Fusion remains
  enabled, as well as Commons Roots, a new Commons base theme.
- The panels module and all previously included panels have been removed
  from the distribution. In previous versions, the home page, user profile,
  and group home page were rendered by Panels. If you'd like to continue 
  using panels, you must download the module separately and place it in your
  sites/all/modules directory. Since the panel exports that came with Commons 
  are now gone, in order to continue using them, you must save a copy of 
  them from within the panels UI prior to upgrading to 1.6, so they remain
  in your database.
- Context is now being used to render all of the previously mentioned pages,
  as well as all other pages.
- The Admin Menu module has been replaced by the Admin module. This provides
  several benefits: it eliminates the nuiscance of menus dropping down and
  interfering with usability; and it contains an editor for the Context module,
  which is required in order to control the vertical ordering of blocks on a
  page when being controlled by Context. Click the wrench icon in the top-right
  corner of any page to view both the Context editor as well as the normal
  "Admin" functions previously found in the Admin Menu.  To edit Contexts,
  click on "Context editor" in that sidebar; from there, you can edit the
  blocks and their layout for every page.
- OG Features has been added to the distribution. This allows admins and 
  group managers to turn off groups of features within each individual
  group. Group Admins will now see a "Features" tab beside the Edit tab on
  the group home page where these can be controlled.
- All of the Features within the distribution have been rebuilt, leading
  to most of the exports (views, contexts, etc) being renamed and redesigned.
  If you have altered and saved any of the previous exports, they will 
  persist within your database. It is important that you carefully review
  any of these depreciated components and disable or remove them to they 
  do not interfere with the new ones.
  (See: http://commons.acquia.com/wiki/feature-components-removed-commons-16) 
- There are also two new Features available:
 - Commons Shoutbox: Contains the Shoutbox components from Commons Core,
   making it possible to now completely disable Shoutbox from Commons,
   if desired.
 - Commons Invite: Provides functionality to allow site users to invite other
   people to your site.
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 1.6:
NOTE: THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE.  You should NOT install it directly on
a live site without first testing it on a staging site.
1. Carefully review the NOTES above
2. Backup your code and database
3. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
4. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of this archive.
 - It is important that you do not *merge* the new codebase, as a number of modules were
   remove or relocated!
5. Update your site via /update.php
 - Ignore any errors about missing Panels files
6. Make sure the Page manager module is disabled. Or, if you wish to continue
  using it, delete any pages using the path "/home", the Node template, and
  the User profile template, which may be leftover from a previous version 
  of Commons.
7. Navigate to the admin theme page (admin/build/themes)
 - Ensure that Fusion Core and Commons Roots (both base themes) are enabled
 - Ensure that at least one Commons-supported theme is enabled, and choose
   your desired default theme (if not already set)
 - The original Acquia Commons theme is now named Commons Origins
8. View the status report (admin/reports/status) to see if there are any
  errors to tend to
9. Take the time to delete or disable any of the components listed at:
   http://commons.acquia.com/wiki/feature-components-removed-commons-16
  - This is extremely important!
  - Once done, navigate to all areas of your site, making sure there is 
    no remaining strange or duplicate behavior of any kind.
10. Navigate to the Features admin page (admin/build/features)
 - Determine which features are overridden
 - Click on the overridden link for each feature to review what the 
   the overrides are for each component inside the given feature
 - If possible, revert as many components as possible, remembering that
   reverting a component will remove any customizations you've made to
   the given item
11. A bug revealed in Heartbeat led to the need for an additional permission
  to be created (access user activity). Users will need this permission
  in order to see the activity streams on group home pages. Commons comes
  with this permission given to anonymous and authenticated users by default,
  but you may have to either revert the Commons Core feature, or assigned
  the permissions manually, if upgrading.
12. Because of the introduction of Commons Profile (Feature) to handle
  the profile aspects of Commons, if you have deleted any profile fields
  that came with Commons initially, they will be restored after the upgrade.
  You must go in (admin/user/profile) and remove them once again.
13. If no issues have arisen, it is recommended that you make another backup
  of your codebase and database, then you may turn off maintenance mode.

Commons 1.3, 2011-02-04
------------------------------------
NOTES:
 - Excluded module updates:
  * User terms
    - Commons 1.0 contained a large patch which introduced free-tagging to
      user terms. Until we re-evaluate exactly what functionality we want
      for user tagging, we will continue to use the version that we started
      with.
 - Commons Dashboard [new feature] requires PHP 5.2.x (or higher)
  * This is because of the Homebox module, which uses functions introduced
    in PHP 5.2.
  * If you do not have PHP 5.2.x (or higher) installed, this feature will
    not be enabled during a site upgrade, and will not be available during
    site installation. If you upgrade to an adequate version of PHP at a
    later time, you can enable this feature via the Features admin interface.
------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 1.3:
1. Backup your code and database
2. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
3. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of this archive.
 - It is important that you do not *merge* the new codebase, as a number of modules were
   remove or relocated!
4. Update your site via /update.php
5. Ignore any errors about missing included/required files 
 - Those are caused by some modules changing location
 - Ignore SQL errors from Context and/or Rules
6. View the status of the features (admin/build/features)
7. If any features are overridden, view the components of the feature that are overridden
 - It's recommended that you revert all the overridden components, but be aware that
   this will revert any custom changes you've made to those components
8. Review the available Contexts (admin/build/context)
 - Delete or disable context_ui-dashboard-dashboard, as it's no longer used by Commons
   but may still be saved in your database
9. Review the available Pages (admin/build/pages)
 - Delete or disable page-Home, as it's no longer used by Commons but may
   still be saved in your database
 - Being that Commons 1.2 now comes with a new home page, you may want to review
   it and make any changes you deem necessary
10. Review your input format and filters. WYSIWYG Filter has been set to be used
  in place of HTML Filter (for the Filtered HTML format)
11. Review the user permissions and roles
12. Clear the cache (admin/settings/performance)
13. Ensure the rest of your site is functioning as expected
14. Check the status report for any errors. Address them, if needed.
